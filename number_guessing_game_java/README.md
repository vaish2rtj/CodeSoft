# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Java GUI Edition

This is a fun and interactive number guessing game built using Java and Swing. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. It’s designed as part of my project work under the **CODESOFT Internship Program**.

## 🧩 How the Game Works

- When the game starts, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
- The player enters their guesses through a graphical interface.
- After each guess, feedback is provided:
  - **Too high**
  - **Too low**
  - **Correct!**
- The player has a total of 7 attempts to guess correctly.
- A score is calculated based on how many attempts are left.
- After each round, the player is given the option to play again.
